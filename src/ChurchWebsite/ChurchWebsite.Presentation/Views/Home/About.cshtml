                            Burgessville Baptist Church is celebrating its 180th Anniversary in October of this year (2017). The church began in 1837 and the beautiful yellow brick 
                            building was built at the top of Burgessville hill a few years later. Since its beginnings, Burgessville Baptist Church (BBC) has been affiliated with 
                            the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec and has had a long history loving and serving Burgessville and the surrounding communities.

            <h3>What do Baptists Believe</h3>
            <p>We are part of the Convention Baptists of Ontario and Quebec. We believe and hold to their mandates and support the denomination in all its distinctives. 
            We are a church that believes all people can come, worship, be part of the Kingdom of God and have a role within the work and ministries of our church. 
            We do not discriminate based on age, gender or background and believe God loves and has called all people to be part of His family. You are welcome here!</p>
            <h3>1. Jesus is Lord</h3>
            <p>Baptists believe that Jesus Christ, being eternally God, only begotten Son and the visible expression of the invisible God, effectively procured salvation for 
            all creation through his death, burial and resurrection. He is the one assigned by God the Father to rule with authority over all of creation. 
            Every area of the believer’s life and the life of the church is to be subject to the Lord.</p>
            <h3>2. The Word of God is the Authoritative Rule of Faith and Practice</h3>
            <p>
                Baptists believe that God communicates his will through the inspired Word of God. For Baptists, the Bible is the final authority in matters of faith and practice.  
                It is to be interpreted responsibly under the guidance of God’s Holy Spirit within the community of faith.
            </p>
            <h3>3. The Priesthood of All Believers</h3>
            <p>
                The Bible affirms the value of each person as having been created in the image of God, and also declares each person morally responsible for his/her own nature and behaviour. 
                Baptists believe that inherent in the worth of each person is also the right and competency of each individual personally to deal directly with God through Jesus Christ. 
                This principle also suggests our responsibility to serve other believers in intercession and nurture: we are priests to each other.  Baptists believe that no group or individual 
                has any right to compel others—forcefully or politically—to believe or worship as they do. Rather, Baptists have historically been champions of <strong>religious liberty</strong>.
            </p>
            <h3>4. A Believers’ Church</h3>
            <p>
                Baptists believe that Jesus Christ chooses to form his church by bringing together believers for the purpose of worship, witness, fellowship and ministry (both spiritual and social). 
                Baptists recognize the church universal as all who truly profess faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. They also profess their understanding of the church as being visibly 
                expressed in local congregations. Each local church must thus be made up of believers who, upon their profession of faith and their baptism (almost always by immersion), are 
                incorporated into the local church through the activity of the Holy Spirit. Baptists believe that <strong>Believers’ Baptism</strong> and the <strong>Lord’s Supper</strong> are the <strong>two ordinances</strong>
                required by the New Testament and are to be administered by the local church.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Mission and Evangelism</h3>
            <p>
                We have a story to tell that is mandated by our Lord in the Great Commission of Matthew 28:19-20. Our calling is to share God’s message of love and salvation with each person.   
                Each Christian has a duty to share their faith with others.  Baptists continue to be very active in mission efforts, both in local and global contexts. We recognize that mission 
                is not just evangelism, but also includes promoting justice, social welfare, healing, education and peace in the world.  It is a holistic approach that expresses care for both the 
                needs of the human soul and the social needs that affect all of life.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Church Autonomy and Association</h3>
            <p>
                Government in a local church is controlled by the principles of the priesthood of all believers, the Lordship of Christ, the authority of the Scriptures and the guidance 
                and power of the Holy Spirit. Christ, present in the lives of congregational members, leads them corporately to discover and obey his mind and will. Such ‘<strong>congregational
                government’</strong> calls for and expresses the equality and responsibility of believers under the Lordship of Christ. Baptist churches also recognize the need to temper the exercise of 
                their autonomy in order to ‘<strong>associate</strong>’ by linking regionally, nationally and internationally for ministry, mission, support and fellowship.
            </p>
            <h3>7. Freedom and Equality</h3>
            <p>
                Emerging from our convictions about the priesthood of all believers, we affirm that in Jesus Christ all people are equal. Each one is free to be in relationship with God 
                and to express a faith that is not coerced. Faith cannot be predetermined by someone else, but is the right of and responsibility of each individual as they seek a relationship 
                with God based on their own personal commitments. A further extension of the principle of the Lordship of Christ and the priesthood of believers is to be found in the Baptist 
                conviction that there must exist a <strong>separation between the church and civil governments</strong>.
